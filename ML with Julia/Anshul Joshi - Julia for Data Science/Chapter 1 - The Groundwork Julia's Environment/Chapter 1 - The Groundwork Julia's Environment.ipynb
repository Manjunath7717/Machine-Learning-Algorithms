In 2009, three developers (Stefan Karpinski, Jeff Bezanson, and Viral Shah) at MIT in the Applied Computing group under the supervision of Prof. Alan Edelman started working on a project that lead to Julia. In February 2012, Julia was presented publicly and became open source. The source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)."
